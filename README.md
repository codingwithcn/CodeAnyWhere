__What is CodeAnyWhere__
>CodeAnyWhere is a free web application that allows you to access you computer folders from another computer. Giving you the ability to make edits to files and save those changes.

__How to get started__
>1. First you will have to pip install this project from github or directly download it from github.com

>2. Next open up the command line and head insides this project location.

>3. Once in, download a virtual environment with the following command "python -m venv env"

>4. Next you will have to activate the virtual environment

>5. Once activated pip install the requirements. With this command: 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'

>6. Now you can run the project with this command: 'python main.py'

>7. Wait for it to load and start running. Once done you should see a line printed out saying "Running on (the ip address its running)" copy and paste the ip address to the browser of your choosing.

>8. You should now be in the home page. Now you would have to create an account. This can be done to ways:
>>1. Open up the database and create a new row in the user database. Giving it a name and password. __Would not advice this if you are not totally sure what you are doing because this could affect how the system runs if done incorrectly__
>>2. Sign up for an account. On the home page you should see a sign up button at the top of the page. Click on it. You should be taking to the sign up page. Sign up an account and head over to the home page and log in.

>9. Once logged in you would be able to edit, save and access you computer folders from any computer in your local network

>10. __If you want to access you computer folders from anywhere you are. You will need to open your ports to outside connections. But doing this would open you computer up to attacks. Meaning anyone will be able to see and change your computer folders/files__.
