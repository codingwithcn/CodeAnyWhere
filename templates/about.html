                <h1>What is CodeAnyWhere</h1>
                <p>CodeAnyWhere is a free web application that allows you to access your development folders, and change the files from where ever you are at the moment.</p>
                <h1>How I came up with the idea</h1>
                <p>It happened when I had to leave my workspace suddenly with no warning. Giving me no chance to save files on another computer or even on Github. I was extremely annoyed by this. Which forced me to think of better and more time efficient ways to do what I love. Leading to CodeAnyWhere.</p>
                <h1>How to get started</h1>
                <h4>Assuming you are reading this, I am guessing you already know how to get started. But if you are still confuse I will gladly explain.</h4>
                <ul role="list">
                    <li>First you would either have to pip install this project from Github or directly to github and get this.</li>
                    <li>Next you will need to open your command line and then head inside this project location</li>
                    <li>Once in, download a virtual env using the command:&quot;python -m pip venv env &quot;</li>
                    <li>Next you will have to activate this virtual environment.</li>
                    <li>Once activated you can now run the program with the command: &quot;python main.py &quot;</li>
                    <li>Wait for it to load. Once loaded, you should see a statement saying: &quot;Running on (the ip address its running on)&quot;. Copy and paste that Ip address into you web browser of your choosing.</li>
                    <li>You should be taking to the home page. Then you would have to create an account. You can do this two ways: 1. Head over to the database and then to the user table and add in a new account. If you are not sure what you are doing I do not advise doing that, because a simple mistake could mess up the database and the program. 2. You can simply sign up using the website. On the home page there should be a &quot;SignUp &quot;. Click on that and you would be taking to the sign up page.</li>
                    <li>Once you have create an account, head over to Login and you can now access you folders from any computer on your local network.</li>
                    <li>If you would like to access your files world wide. You will need to learn about port forwarding, and open your ports to incoming connections. But be warned this process is dangerous because it means you will be open to attacks. And people might be able to access you information.</li>
                </ul>
